# Boat Rentals

This project is an individual attempt to tackle supervised learning (regression) methods in a business context. It consists
of two main notebooks:
- [report.ipynb](https://github.com/dissagaliyeva/boat-rentals/blob/master/report.ipynb) = summarizes the work and presents the findings in a report-type of way
- [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/dissagaliyeva/boat-rentals/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) = shows the complete code and explanation

Both report and code are also hosted on DataCamp for easier access & beautiful representation. [Click here](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/dissagaliyeva)

## Objective

Finding the perfect recipe to increase the sign-up ratio and the traffic into the website is definitely 
challenging. It gets even more so, if the sign-up experience is full of endless questions. This notebook 
was created to attempt facing these challenges. To do so, we have been provided with a dataset that 
consists 9888 entries. Even though the dataset does not seem that big, it's extremely inconsistent. It 
required a lot of cleaning, standardization, and reformatting. 

### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization 
* Feature Selection
* Regression analysis 

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, sklearn, numpy, scipy
* matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
* etc. 

## Project Description

The analysis was conducted to predict the number of views a boat ad would get. Also, the
customer wanted to see whether the currently asked questions are too long. To answer that,
we were supplemented with almost 10,000 entries with terrible categorical columns condition. 

Categorical columns accounted for 60% of the columns and needed a lot of alteration, cleaning,
and standardization. To give an example of the condition, "Location" column had 2995 unique
values. If proper cleaning didn't occur, that would lead to dimensionality blowup.
